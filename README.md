Module 2 Challenge Submission

## Overview of Project: 
* Background - We have been asked by Steve to create an efficient method for analyzing stocks. In Module 2, VBA was utilized to identify the total daily volume and return for a given list of stock tickers in 2017 and 2018. The issue with the module 2 solution was that the code may not be scalable to more stock tickers and may not execute in as little time as possible. 

* Purpose - The purpose of this exercise is to refactor the code from Module 2 to make it run faster and collect information more efficiently. By changing the method of data collection, we hope to have the code run faster and output the same insights on stock performance. 

## Results:

## Summary: 
*Why refactor code
*Advantages and disadvantages of the orginal and refactored VBA script
